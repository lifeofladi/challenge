# CHALLENGE

**Task:**

Implement a web page that shows a list of users in tiles format similar to googles image search.

**Instructions:**

- [*] The page will be vertically scrollable and we show as many tiles as possible on each row. Each tile has 180px width and 170px height. You can use any styles (padding, margin, color, background color, fonts) that you think makes the page prettier but it is not a priority.

- [*] Each user has a profile iage, username, age, and description which are shown on their tile in that order.

- [ ] Generate 100 users randomly to display on the page. this means their username, age, and descriptions are all randomly generated strings and numbers. For the profile image use [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) service to generate a random image for each user.
